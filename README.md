# Introduction :
# Objective :
Our objective is to build a system to predict IMDB users’ rating about movies with different algorithms and compare their performance through a benchmark.
# Dataset :
The dataset can be dowbloaded from this website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies.
# Why other approach is no good ?
Since IMDB has been working on the recommendation system for many years, countless algorithms were invented to improve the accuracy of 7 prediction. However, it is lack of the comparison of the recent algorithms, because users’ behaviors changes all the time, every little change of the webpage of IMDB or the movie industry might cause significant effect on users’ rating habit according to the butterfly effect. So data scientists should track the performance of different algorithms and make sure the best one if chosen to provide the most effective prediction.
# Area or Scope of Investigation :
The arenas of this project include data mining, machine learning and recommendation system.
